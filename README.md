Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? The client was DriverPass, and they wanted me to design a system for their driving school that would provide learning modules, online tests, and the ability to purchase packages for driving lessons online.

What did you do particularly well? I think I did well in the interface along with making the graphs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would choose to change the functional requirements. i owuld make it more simple to understand the requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I looked over the DriverPass interview transcript to look for the customers need/want. Due to wanting to make the best product for the customer asa they would be using the product the most.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? I approach designing software by making a list of the user requests. In the future, I would have more interviews/transcripts to get more of an indepth picture of what the customer wants rather than the one we were given.
